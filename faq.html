  <h1>General</h1>

  <button class="accordion">Who can I contact for questions on billing and my invoices?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>We're happy to help! Call us at <a href="tel:601116119380" target="_blank">+601116119380</a>
      to talk through your billing questions.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">What is my security deposit for?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The security deposit is a set amount of money that the landlord takes from you as collateral for the structural
      integrity and cleanliness of the house. In other words, this money is set aside by the landlord to inspire tenants
      to take good care of their rental property, and if you don't, it gives them the opportunity to recoup those
      losses.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">How do I get my security deposit back?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>If you keep the house in good condition and don't inflict any damages on the property, then you will
      get your security deposit back
      at the end of your lease. To ensure that there are no misunderstandings between you and the landlord,
      be sure to take inventory of
      any wear-and-tear you see when you move in, preferably via photo. This way no pre-existing damages can
      be mistakenly blamed on you
      and you can get your security deposit returned fair and square. Generally, landlords are required to
      return the security deposit 30 days after the lease ends.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">What are utilities and how are they paid for?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Utilities are the basics you need any housing unit: electricity, heat, water, trash pickup. Sometimes these
      bills are included in
      your rent payment and are handled by your landlord, but other times the tenant directly receives the bill.
      Be sure to ask your landlord
      about utilities before signing the lease so you know what you'll be expected to pay for.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">What is the difference between a month-to-month and a fixed-term lease?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>It is very important to know the difference between these two terms, as they will determine how long you'll
      stay at a place and sometimes
      even the rent price. A fixed-term lease is an agreement that states the tenant will remain in the apartment
      or home for a pre-determined
      amount of time usually a year. Month-to-month leases also tend to have higher rent prices because the
      landlord is not guaranteed income
      for the next month. Unless you are in a precarious or time-sensitive situation, it's often a better
      financial call to go with the fixed-term lease.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Can a landlord raise my rent during my stay?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Landlords are allowed to raise the rent once the lease has expired. If you decide to stay in the same apartment
      next year, you should read your new lease carefully and make sure the rates haven't gone up. If they have, see if
      you can negotiate with your landlord. If you are renting a month-to-month apartment, then rent increases are more
      likely to occur. In this case, landlords can raise the rent every month if they wish. But it's important to note
      that many states require a 30 day notice before the rent is officially raised. This will give you time to find a
      new place if you cannot afford the new rent price.</p>
  </div>


  <button class="accordion">Is renter's insurance required?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Most rentals these days require tenants to have insurance. Even if you're leasing a unit that doesn't mandate
      having renter's insurance, it may be worthwhile to get one. Renter's insurance can protect you from any damages
      caused by natural calamities, plumbing issues, theft, etc.</p>
  </div>
